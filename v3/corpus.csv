Does your organization give any awareness of cyber threats to your employees?,Syncplify,2024-12-05,"While companies invest heavily in advanced technologies and systems to protect data, the human factor remains one of the most significant vulnerabilities in cybersecurity. Cybercriminals use human factors to get unauthorized access, steal information, and infect systems with malware. Even the best technology doesn’t help if the people are not educated, engaged, and empowered to recognize and respond to security threats.

Here are some of the common human-caused cybersecurity breaches:

PHISHING ATTACKS

This cyber attack typically involves deceptive emails, text messages, or websites that trick individuals into divulging sensitive information such as credit card numbers and passwords.

SOCIAL ENGINEERING

Cybercriminals often use psychological manipulation techniques to trick individuals into actions that compromise security. Social engineering attacks target human emotions, exploiting trust, curiosity, fear, or the desire to help others.

WEAK PASSWORD PRACTICES

Passwords are a major weak point in cybersecurity, with many individuals using easy passwords, reusing them, or neglecting multifactor authentication.

POOR SOFTWARE MANAGEMENT

Unregular software updates cause 60% of data breaches. Optimizing these processes should be a priority for all organizations.

INSIDER THREATS

The 2023 Insider Threat Report by Ponemon Institute found a 44% increase in insider threats over the past two years, with the average incident costing $15.38 million.

Compared to experienced cybersecurity specialists trained to anticipate risks, the average employee with a lack of awareness may overlook the signs of a potential cyberattack. Studies show that 82% of organizations have experienced a cyber attack due to human error in the past three years. 

Organizations are now starting to understand the need for comprehensive training programs that focus not just on technology but also on awareness and cultivation of positive security behaviors. Teaching employees about the latest threats, instilling a culture of security, and encouraging open communication about potential risks are critical steps in safeguarding sensitive data.

We all need to remember that cybersecurity is not just about technology - it’s about people. By understanding and mitigating the human factors contributing to the knowledge gap in cybersecurity, organizations can better protect themselves against the ever-present threat of cyberattacks.

Does your organization give any awareness of cyber threats to your employees? Please share your experience. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/data/comments/1h6vjsb/does_your_organization_give_any_awareness_of/

Data Gathering from Path Constrained Mobile Sensors Using Data MULE,Dinesh Dash,2016-12-13,"In Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) sensor nodes are deployed to sense useful data from environment. Sensors are energy-constrained devices. To prolong the sensor network lifetime, now a days mobile robots (sometimes refer as data sink, data mules, or data collectors) are used for collecting the sensed data from the sensors. In this environment sensor nodes directly transfer their sensed data to the data mules. Sensed data are sometime time sensitive; therefore, the data should be collected within a predefined period. Hence, depending on the speed of the data mules the trajectory lengths of the data mules have upper limits. In this paper an approximation algorithm is proposed for collecting data from the mobile sensors using mobile data collectors",http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04053v1
A Survey on Sampling and Profiling over Big Data (Technical Report),"Zhicheng Liu, Aoqian Zhang",2020-05-08,"Due to the development of internet technology and computer science, data is exploding at an exponential rate. Big data brings us new opportunities and challenges. On the one hand, we can analyze and mine big data to discover hidden information and get more potential value. On the other hand, the 5V characteristic of big data, especially Volume which means large amount of data, brings challenges to storage and processing. For some traditional data mining algorithms, machine learning algorithms and data profiling tasks, it is very difficult to handle such a large amount of data. The large amount of data is highly demanding hardware resources and time consuming. Sampling methods can effectively reduce the amount of data and help speed up data processing. Hence, sampling technology has been widely studied and used in big data context, e.g., methods for determining sample size, combining sampling with big data processing frameworks. Data profiling is the activity that finds metadata of data set and has many use cases, e.g., performing data profiling tasks on relational data, graph data, and time series data for anomaly detection and data repair. However, data profiling is computationally expensive, especially for large data sets. Therefore, this paper focuses on researching sampling and profiling in big data context and investigates the application of sampling in different categories of data profiling tasks. From the experimental results of these studies, the results got from the sampled data are close to or even exceed the results of the full amount of data. Therefore, sampling technology plays an important role in the era of big data, and we also have reason to believe that sampling technology will become an indispensable step in big data processing in the future.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05079v1
Data Science: A Comprehensive Overview,Longbing Cao,2020-07-01,"The twenty-first century has ushered in the age of big data and data economy, in which data DNA, which carries important knowledge, insights and potential, has become an intrinsic constituent of all data-based organisms. An appropriate understanding of data DNA and its organisms relies on the new field of data science and its keystone, analytics. Although it is widely debated whether big data is only hype and buzz, and data science is still in a very early phase, significant challenges and opportunities are emerging or have been inspired by the research, innovation, business, profession, and education of data science. This paper provides a comprehensive survey and tutorial of the fundamental aspects of data science: the evolution from data analysis to data science, the data science concepts, a big picture of the era of data science, the major challenges and directions in data innovation, the nature of data analytics, new industrialization and service opportunities in the data economy, the profession and competency of data education, and the future of data science.

BDGS: A Scalable Big Data Generator Suite in Big Data Benchmarking,"Zijian Ming, Chunjie Luo, Wanling Gao, Rui Han, Qiang Yang, Lei Wang, Jianfeng Zhan",2014-01-22,"Data generation is a key issue in big data benchmarking that aims to generate application-specific data sets to meet the 4V requirements of big data. Specifically, big data generators need to generate scalable data (Volume) of different types (Variety) under controllable generation rates (Velocity) while keeping the important characteristics of raw data (Veracity). This gives rise to various new challenges about how we design generators efficiently and successfully. To date, most existing techniques can only generate limited types of data and support specific big data systems such as Hadoop. Hence we develop a tool, called Big Data Generator Suite (BDGS), to efficiently generate scalable big data while employing data models derived from real data to preserve data veracity. The effectiveness of BDGS is demonstrated by developing six data generators covering three representative data types (structured, semi-structured and unstructured) and three data sources (text, graph, and table data).",http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5465v3
Modern Data Formats for Big Bioinformatics Data Analytics,"Shahzad Ahmed, M.

This data is of no use if it is not properly analyzed. ETL (Extraction, Transformation, Loading) is an important step in designing data analytics applications. ETL requires proper understanding of features of data. Data format plays a key role in understanding of data, representation of data, space required to store data, data I/O during processing of data, intermediate results of processing, in-memory analysis of data and overall time required to process data. Different data mining and machine learning algorithms require input data in specific types and formats. This paper explores the data formats used by different tools and algorithms and also presents modern data formats that are used on Big Data Platform. It will help researchers and developers in choosing appropriate data format to be used for a particular tool or algorithm.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05364v1
A Forecasting-Based DLP Approach for Data Security,"Kishu Gupta, Ashwani Kush",2023-12-21,"Sensitive data leakage is the major growing problem being faced by enterprises in this technical era. Data leakage causes severe threats for organization of data safety which badly affects the reputation of organizations. Data leakage is the flow of sensitive data/information from any data holder to an unauthorized destination. Data leak prevention (DLP) is set of techniques that try to alleviate the threats which may hinder data security. DLP unveils guilty user responsible for data leakage and ensures that user without appropriate permission cannot access sensitive data and also provides protection to sensitive data if sensitive data is shared accidentally. In this paper, data leakage prevention (DLP) model is used to restrict/grant data access permission to user, based on the forecast of their access to data. This study provides a DLP solution using data statistical analysis to forecast the data access possibilities of any user in future based on the access to data in the past. The proposed approach makes use of renowned simple piecewise linear function for learning/training to model. The results show that the proposed DLP approach with high level of precision can correctly classify between users even in cases of extreme data access.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13704v1
A Random Sample Partition Data Model for Big Data Analysis,"Salman Salloum, Yulin He, Joshua Zhexue Huang, Xiaoliang Zhang, Tamer Z. Emara, Chenghao Wei, Heping He",2017-12-12,"Big data sets must be carefully partitioned into statistically similar data subsets that can be used as representative samples for big data analysis tasks. In this paper, we propose the random sample partition (RSP) data model to represent a big data set as a set of non-overlapping data subsets, called RSP data blocks, where each RSP data block has a probability distribution similar to the whole big data set. Under this data model, efficient block level sampling is used to randomly select RSP data blocks, replacing expensive record level sampling to select sample data from a big distributed data set on a computing cluster. We show how RSP data blocks can be employed to estimate statistics of a big data set and build models which are equivalent to those built from the whole big data set. In this approach, analysis of a big data set becomes analysis of few RSP data blocks which have been generated in advance on the computing cluster. Therefore, the new method for data analysis based on RSP data blocks is scalable to big data.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04146v2
Microservices based Linked Data Quality Model for Buildings Energy   Management Services,"Muhammad Aslam Jarwar, Sajjad Ali, Ilyoung Chong",2019-10-11,"During the production, distribution, and consumption of energy, a large quantity of data is generated. For efficiently using of energy resources other supplementary data such as building information, weather, and environmental data etc. are also collected and used. All these energy data and relevant data is published as linked data in order to enhance the reusability of data and maximization of energy management services capability. However, the quality of this linked data is questionable because of wear and tears of sensors, unreliable communication channels, and highly diversification of data sources. The provision of high-quality energy management services requires high quality linked data, which reduces billing cost and improve the quality of the living environment. Assessment and improvement methodologies for the quality of data along with linked data needs to process very diverse data from highly diverse data sources. Microservices based data-driven architecture has great significance to processes highly diverse linked data with modularity, scalability, and reliability. This paper proposed microservices based architecture along with domain data and metadata ontologies to enhance and assess energy-related linked data quality.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06115v1
Toward a view-based data cleaning architecture,"Toshiyuki Shimizu, Hiroki Omori, Masatoshi Yoshikawa",2019-10-24,"Big data analysis has become an active area of study with the growth of machine learning techniques. To properly analyze data, it is important to maintain high-quality data. Thus, research on data cleaning is also important. It is difficult to automatically detect and correct inconsistent values for data requiring expert knowledge or data created by many contributors, such as integrated data from heterogeneous data sources. An example of such data is metadata for scientific datasets, which should be confirmed by data managers while handling the data. To support the efficient cleaning of data by data managers, we propose a data cleaning architecture in which data managers interactively browse and correct portions of data through views. In this paper, we explain our view-based data cleaning architecture and discuss some remaining issues.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11040v1
Technical Report: Developing a Working Data Hub,"Vijay Gadepally, Jeremy Kepner",2020-04-01,"Data forms a key component of any enterprise. The need for high quality and easy access to data is further amplified by organizations wishing to leverage machine learning or artificial intelligence for their operations. To this end, many organizations are building resources for managing heterogenous data, providing end-users with an organization wide view of available data, and acting as a centralized repository for data owned/collected by an organization. Very broadly, we refer to these class of techniques as a ""data hub."" While there is no clear definition of what constitutes a data hub, some of the key characteristics include: data catalog; links to data sets or owners of data sets or centralized data repository; basic ability to serve / visualize data sets; access control policies that ensure secure data access and respects policies of data owners; and computing capabilities tied with data hub infrastructure. Of course, developing such a data hub entails numerous challenges. This document provides background in databases, data management and outlines best practices and recommendations for developing and deploying a working data hub.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00190v2
