Just spent $6k on a NLP therapy package for 6 months,asura1194,2024-11-30,"I hope it's worth it. This year alone I already spent $14k on my mental health care. Psychedelic sessions (it was worth it), Internal Family Systems therapy (for the present and the past), now NLP (for the present and the future). All of these out of pocket on payment plans because I never had good experiences with cheap therapists who take insurance, especially ones working in government-funded facilities. I burned through like 7 regular therapists last year and decided to go for the unconventional modalities and the type of therapists who don't take insurance at all. The type who can sit for multiple hours with you in one session to get really deep instead of ""whelp your hour is up, see you next week!"" just as you start unravelling and you need to check yourself for the next several days.

The NLP therapist/hypnotherapist I found via word of mouth cost $6k for a 6 month program package. It's a big financial commitment and I can't just fire her in the middle of the program if we're not a good fit. I hope it's worth it. Something I learned about therapy and mental health is treat it like plastic surgery - don't be cheap or try to save money, go for the best you can find. Trying to be cheap with therapy is like flying to Turkey for a botched nose job. I rather overpay for something that really works, rather than underpay for shitty service that does nothing - because the latter it's better off if you spent nothing at all.

Wish me luck, I hope it's worth it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/1h3i84j/just_spent_6k_on_a_nlp_therapy_package_for_6/
Looking for NLP Practitioners to Help with Social Anxiety,Glittering_Sort_8738,2024-11-29,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been struggling with severe social anxiety for a while now. It often prevents me from leaving the house, going to the gym, or even talking to the cashier when paying for groceries.

I’ve tried various methods to overcome this, including hypnosis tapes, CBT therapy with a professional, talk therapy with another therapist, and sessions with a certified NLP and Hypnosis practitioner. Unfortunately, none of these have worked for me so far. I’m also on medication, but it doesn’t seem to be helping either (I’ll be discussing this with my psychiatrist again at the beginning of December).

If you’re looking to practice your NLP skills and try different techniques, I’m willing to be your subject. I can provide feedback immediately after the session, as well as a day, a week, or even weeks later—whatever you need.
Feel free to DM me if you’re interested.

How can NLP help me feel accteptable and lovable for who and what I am?,Sam4639,2024-11-24,"I suffered from severe emotion neglect and being bullied at school, an abusive marriage and more then 1.5 years of no income since the start of corona.

It all resulted in a severe form of self rejection and becoming a boundaryless codependend pleaser. My goal for this year is that therapists start asking different questions. My goal for next year, is that therapists have as topic shame to discuss with their clients, instead of asking them ""How was your week?"" Shame is the complex emotion that comes with feeling not acceptable and lovable for who we are and can have severe impact on our self perception, of what makes us feel acceptable and lovable. It can severly impacts our identity and confidence with the roles we fulfill in life, like at work and in private with friends, family and even when alone.

I escaped myself by numbing my feelings and emotions, and by overthinking. How can NLP help me with embracing my feelings, emotions and my simple unique self? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/1gyldvk/how_can_nlp_help_me_feel_accteptable_and_lovable/

Training an NLP Scholar at a Small Liberal Arts College: A Backwards   Designed Course Proposal,"Grusha Prasad, Forrest Davis",2024-08-11,"The rapid growth in natural language processing (NLP) over the last couple years has generated student interest and excitement in learning more about the field. In this paper, we present two types of students that NLP courses might want to train. First, an ""NLP engineer"" who is able to flexibly design, build and apply new technologies in NLP for a wide range of tasks. Second, an ""NLP scholar"" who is able to pose, refine and answer questions in NLP and how it relates to the society, while also learning to effectively communicate these answers to a broader audience. While these two types of skills are not mutually exclusive -- NLP engineers should be able to think critically, and NLP scholars should be able to build systems -- we think that courses can differ in the balance of these skills. As educators at Small Liberal Arts Colleges, the strengths of our students and our institution favors an approach that is better suited to train NLP scholars. In this paper we articulate what kinds of skills an NLP scholar should have, and then adopt a backwards design to propose course components that can aid the acquisition of these skills.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05664v1
Towards Systematic Monolingual NLP Surveys: GenA of Greek NLP,"Juli Bakagianni, Kanella Pouli, Maria Gavriilidou, John Pavlopoulos",2024-07-13,"Natural Language Processing (NLP) research has traditionally been predominantly focused on English, driven by the availability of resources, the size of the research community, and market demands. Recently, there has been a noticeable shift towards multilingualism in NLP, recognizing the need for inclusivity and effectiveness across diverse languages and cultures. Monolingual surveys have the potential to complement the broader trend towards multilingualism in NLP by providing foundational insights and resources necessary for effectively addressing the linguistic diversity of global communication. However, monolingual NLP surveys are extremely rare in literature. This study fills the gap by introducing a method for creating systematic and comprehensive monolingual NLP surveys. Characterized by a structured search protocol, it can be used to select publications and organize them through a taxonomy of NLP tasks. We include a classification of Language Resources (LRs), according to their availability, and datasets, according to their annotation, to highlight publicly-available and machine-actionable LRs. By applying our method, we conducted a systematic literature review of Greek NLP from 2012 to 2022, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state and challenges of Greek NLP research. We discuss the progress of Greek NLP and outline encountered Greek LRs, classified by availability and usability. As we show, our proposed method helps avoid common pitfalls, such as data leakage and contamination, and to assess language support per NLP task. We consider this systematic literature review of Greek NLP an application of our method that showcases the benefits of a monolingual NLP survey. Similar applications could be regard the myriads of languages whose progress in NLP lags behind that of well-supported languages.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09861v2
"Sejarah dan Perkembangan Teknik Natural Language Processing (NLP) Bahasa   Indonesia: Tinjauan tentang sejarah, perkembangan teknologi, dan aplikasi NLP   dalam bahasa Indonesia",Mukhlis Amien,2023-03-28,"This study provides an overview of the history of the development of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in the context of the Indonesian language, with a focus on the basic technologies, methods, and practical applications that have been developed.

The Law and NLP: Bridging Disciplinary Disconnects,"Robert Mahari, Dominik Stammbach, Elliott Ash, Alex 'Sandy' Pentland",2023-10-22,"Legal practice is intrinsically rooted in the fabric of language, yet legal practitioners and scholars have been slow to adopt tools from natural language processing (NLP). At the same time, the legal system is experiencing an access to justice crisis, which could be partially alleviated with NLP. In this position paper, we argue that the slow uptake of NLP in legal practice is exacerbated by a disconnect between the needs of the legal community and the focus of NLP researchers. In a review of recent trends in the legal NLP literature, we find limited overlap between the legal NLP community and legal academia. Our interpretation is that some of the most popular legal NLP tasks fail to address the needs of legal practitioners. We discuss examples of legal NLP tasks that promise to bridge disciplinary disconnects and highlight interesting areas for legal NLP research that remain underexplored.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14346v1
A Survey on Recognizing Textual Entailment as an NLP Evaluation,Adam Poliak,2020-10-06,"Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) was proposed as a unified evaluation framework to compare semantic understanding of different NLP systems. In this survey paper, we provide an overview of different approaches for evaluating and understanding the reasoning capabilities of NLP systems. We then focus our discussion on RTE by highlighting prominent RTE datasets as well as advances in RTE dataset that focus on specific linguistic phenomena that can be used to evaluate NLP systems on a fine-grained level. We conclude by arguing that when evaluating NLP systems, the community should utilize newly introduced RTE datasets that focus on specific linguistic phenomena.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03061v1
Natural Language Processing for Human Resources: A Survey,"Naoki Otani, Nikita Bhutani, Estevam Hruschka",2024-10-21,"The domain of human resources (HR) includes a broad spectrum of tasks related to natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Recent breakthroughs in NLP have generated significant interest in its industrial applications in this domain and potentially alleviate challenges such as the difficulty of resource acquisition and the complexity of problems. At the same time, the HR domain can also present unique challenges that drive state-of-the-art in NLP research. To support this, we provide NLP researchers and practitioners with an overview of key HR tasks from an NLP perspective, illustrating how specific sub-tasks (e.g., skill extraction) contribute to broader objectives (e.g., job matching). Through this survey, we identify opportunities in NLP for HR and suggest directions for future exploration.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16498v1
"A Survey of Race, Racism, and Anti-Racism in NLP","Anjalie Field, Su Lin Blodgett, Zeerak Waseem, Yulia Tsvetkov",2021-06-21,"Despite inextricable ties between race and language, little work has considered race in NLP research and development. In this work, we survey 79 papers from the ACL anthology that mention race. These papers reveal various types of race-related bias in all stages of NLP model development, highlighting the need for proactive consideration of how NLP systems can uphold racial hierarchies. However, persistent gaps in research on race and NLP remain: race has been siloed as a niche topic and remains ignored in many NLP tasks; most work operationalizes race as a fixed single-dimensional variable with a ground-truth label, which risks reinforcing differences produced by historical racism; and the voices of historically marginalized people are nearly absent in NLP literature. By identifying where and how NLP literature has and has not considered race, especially in comparison to related fields, our work calls for inclusion and racial justice in NLP research practices.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11410v2
Large Language Models Meet NLP: A Survey,"Libo Qin, Qiguang Chen, Xiachong Feng, Yang Wu, Yongheng Zhang, Yinghui Li, Min Li, Wanxiang Che, Philip S. Yu",2024-05-21,"While large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown impressive capabilities in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, a systematic investigation of their potential in this field remains largely unexplored. This study aims to address this gap by exploring the following questions: (1) How are LLMs currently applied to NLP tasks in the literature? (2) Have traditional NLP tasks already been solved with LLMs? (3) What is the future of the LLMs for NLP? To answer these questions, we take the first step to provide a comprehensive overview of LLMs in NLP. Specifically, we first introduce a unified taxonomy including (1) parameter-frozen application and (2) parameter-tuning application to offer a unified perspective for understanding the current progress of LLMs in NLP. Furthermore, we summarize the new frontiers and the associated challenges, aiming to inspire further groundbreaking advancements. We hope this work offers valuable insights into the {potential and limitations} of LLMs in NLP, while also serving as a practical guide for building effective LLMs in NLP.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12819v1
Speciesism in Natural Language Processing Research,"Masashi Takeshita, Rafal Rzepka",2024-10-18,"Natural Language Processing (NLP) research on AI Safety and social bias in AI has focused on safety for humans and social bias against human minorities. However, some AI ethicists have argued that the moral significance of nonhuman animals has been ignored in AI research. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate whether there is speciesism, i.e., discrimination against nonhuman animals, in NLP research. First, we explain why nonhuman animals are relevant in NLP research. Next, we survey the findings of existing research on speciesism in NLP researchers, data, and models and further investigate this problem in this study. The findings of this study suggest that speciesism exists within researchers, data, and models, respectively. Specifically, our survey and experiments show that (a) among NLP researchers, even those who study social bias in AI, do not recognize speciesism or speciesist bias; (b) among NLP data, speciesist bias is inherent in the data annotated in the datasets used to evaluate NLP models; (c) OpenAI GPTs, recent NLP models, exhibit speciesist bias by default. Finally, we discuss how we can reduce speciesism in NLP research.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14194v1
